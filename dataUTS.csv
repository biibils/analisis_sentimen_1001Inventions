positive,cybernetix,Amazing book on highlighting the contributions of Muslims who are in these times are severely misunderstood and inappropriately being hated. Read and know!!.
positive,ma sathar,"With increasing bigotry Islamophobia and persecution of Muslims, it is timely that this extraordinary book is on my coffee table. Unfortunately, ""orientalists"" choose to exclude the contributions of Islam to Civilisation instead perpetuate the false world view of Muslims through a “civilisational lens” as a "" Clash of Civilisation""."
positive,amjad kayed,A great book that tells the truth about how much ISLAM AND THE ARABS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO WORLD FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIMES.its unfortunate that true history is not taught in American schools.

positive,jean m,A great reference book for my Islam Contribution unit.
positive,abchwhite,"For Islam, this books remind me of the China of my youth. Like most Americans, fourty-five years ago, I new very little of China's geography culture, economy, politics, education system, and living standards. In my world history class, China had been just a few pages. Then Nixon opened the doors of information between our nations."
positive,abdurachid johnson,The best book ever !!!
positive,fauzi,Great book
positive,cliente amazon,Very very nice
positive,su,This book is the real eye opener introducing great achievements of Islamic Civilization.

positive,siraj i mufti,An excellent description on a number of Muslim inventions. Part of the worldwide show.
positive,wes,"This book should be for everyone. Lots and lots of history and information to review, share and will probably blow your mind at a few points. I would definitely suggest this to all. If you ever have a chance to do a history report I can almost guarantee you will find something in this book for a suitable discussion."
positive,ali aldhaher,Excellent
positive,zafar azam,Thank you got on time good quality.
positive,glenn a martinez,"I was not inclined to like anything muslim, current political situation. I saw the exhibit in Washington at the National Geographic headquarter. Order the book when I got home.....we leave it out for guest.....they seem to really like it."
positive,me in morocco,A very interesting read.
positive,mirth-ennui,"so anybody with arab-islam shelf must get it, for it beautifully packages the fascinating world of islam. 350 pages that work very well as intro for this topic, a difficult one, 'cause islam's 14 hundred years (give or take a century or two), well it's huge ! the book organizes all the relevant intro stuff in 350 pages - it's a feat - significant tip of the hat to everybody involved with it: the exhibition of which the book is catalog, the teamwork of historians that wrote the catalog entries, the engineer (arab origin, teaches Ivy League) that was driving force, national geographic the show sponsor and godfather, well just about everything connected with the project, American soil generated bien sûr but international, is of the toppest level. Also: what Amazon carries is a second or third edition of catalog (I'd guess the original would cost you), but at extremely reasonable price. Some will say it's not a book: that it's a huge magazine - it's ""just"" a catalog (catalog: non-book) - cultural ideology prop stuff - of course they would all be right. but what else does one want these times ? note - praise Allah and grab one quick."
positive,ahmed el attar,Received as described. Thanks.
positive,manal shurafa,Things that I didn't know
positive,shahza bhatti,"This is incredible book with marvelous collections of inventions and science from Islamic history. These Muslim scientists span from Middle East, Turkey, Spain, Iran, Afghanistan and Central Asia. This book shows how Muslim scientists created gliders to fly, astrolabes for measuring star positions, perform surgery, and made great strides in mathematics and geometry. These inventions and discoveries gave a way to European Renaissance and taught the whole world about Arabic numerals, Algebra, Astronomy, Medicine, Chemistry, etc."
positive,sophonsiba,Lost history. Beautiful book. Share!
positive,must qalander,"It is probably the most informative and well written book about the great scientific achievements of human history. Our current knowledge rests on the discoveries of thousands of Muslim scientists and explorers before us. It was amazing to discover how much of what we take for granted today was discovered by Muslim scientists. It is sad that we don't acknowledge Muslim achievements in sciences, exploration, architecture and philosophy that started the renaissance. It truly is a an enduring legacy for all of us to acknowledge and cherish. National Geographic Society has done a great service by supporting this project. It is a well researched and a wonderfully written book."
positive,k s ahmed,Excellent book. I found this book an excellent addition to my classroom library. This book is organized well so people can read form any section and not feel lost. Good for the coffee table or as a gift for people who have everything.
positive,haroon,So Nice
positive,amazon customer,"The book was delivered as expected, and I love the book so much."
positive,waheeda,"Excellent piece of work, and also honest service."
positive,sakina rashid,Interesting read after having gone to the exhibition
positive,fawad sadaf,We went to go see the 1001 muslim invention exhibition at the museum and they were sold out of the books ..so glad I found it on line ..a great read
positive,w o cleland,Excellent introduction to the breadth of Islam and its contribution to the modern world. A major blow at racists and Islamophobes who want to vilify the Muslim community and Islam. It also serves to contrast the situation of post-colonial Muslims with those who enjoyed freedom. Nutty extremism did not survive in those days. The commentary and illustrations are outstanding and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a worthwhile gift to someone interested in the wide world.
positive,ryan,"for knowledge in every where.Who dont know about inventions where are they coming?. you should buy it. three languages arabic,English,and turkish."
positive,a umar,"We were eyeing this book since we went to the 1001 Inventions Exhibition in LA last year, and finally I purchased it, I bought one for my family and one for friend as a gift, and it will be my top item for gift giving for few years: the book is well written: covers the topic in various arenas: home, school, hospital and world etc. and describes the contribution of Muslims towards civilization, it is equally attractive for both adult and a third grader with beautiful colorful pictures and a wealth of information."
positive,l h,"It's very refreshing to finally see a work of science and research giving due where it's worth. Muslim contribution to modern sciences and arts has so long been neglected and forgotten that our children have no idea who the real inventors and discoverers are of so many things we use today. Even names of scientists like ""Ibn Sina"" and ""Al-Razi"" have been mutated in the English language to ""Avicenna"" and ""Razes"", erasing the Arab identity of these great scientists. This book brings back to life a golden era in history - The Middle Ages - that is so very poorly named ""The Dark Ages"". During this era, scientists and inventors of all faiths living in the Muslim civilization made huge contributions in almost every field of science and art that have a life-altering impact on us today. This book is an eye-opener for both adults and children, and I really believe it should be part of every Middle and High School curriculum. Brilliant illustrations, carefully researched text, a wealth of knowledge. A must-have for every household. I purchased one for my family, and will definitely be giving copies of this book as gifts for some time to come."
positive,shahzad chaudry,"Great book, I would recommend to everybody. It provides the right level of detail and information to fully understand. It justifies that Muslims have contributed to society in a meaningful and positive way."
positive,febish,Totally Loved it...!!! I wish the publishers of this book comes up with more n more similar publications. Thumbs up...!!!
positive,zain zaki,Very in-depth material content of the legacy of the Muslims during the days of growth. Proud to be a muslim
positive,kika,1001 Inventions is a very informative desk top book with colourful pictures and genuine examples. It is written beautifully and made easy for any age group with reliable references. A must have historical glossy book and a magnificent read!
positive,kecho,"Great book from every perspective, thanks. Would love to see more things to correct brain washed people thoughts. thanks heaps."
positive,cw,"I would definitely recommend this book to any student in an AP class, or even anyone who just loves to learn. This book covers the time Period 3 (600-1450), and Period 3 covers a lot of ground, but the biggest things that happened were the Mongol Empire, Tang and Song Dynasties, trade networks like the Silk Road and the Indian Ocean Trade Route, and the Abbasid Empire (Islamic Empire). This book includes everything that happened in Period 3 dealing with the Islamic Culture and Religion. That’s what makes this book so great to AP students, because it covers so much of Period 3 in an interesting way."
positive,amazon customer,"Finally a book that begins to tell the truth about Islam's genius! If the truth were permitted, Islam can easily demonstrate men of great genius in all fields of study and aspects of life. A debt of gratitude must be paid to these astoundingly enlightened men and civilisation. This book begins to tell the story and it is done in a very kind and considerate way, so that Western minds will not become angry, hostile and argumentative. There is nothing threatening about knowing the truth of their ingenuity, dedication to health, curiosity which doesn't break the Laws of Nature, love of reading and studying discourses based on reason and respect for One God and their desire for a peaceful equitable society where everyone's rights are respected. It is an excellent beginning book and very much appreciated and needed in order to have a full and complete knowledge of the history of Mankind."
positive,qalb-e-saleem,"I was loaned this book in 2008, and it was a real joy to read. This book needs to be read by all educated Muslims, to know the real facts. It is especially good for young readers, age 10 onwards."
positive,naeem ali,"Very little is known about Islamic history and the positive impact Muslims have made. Muslim contributions in the sciences are vast in its scope, meticulous in its detail and original in its research. None of this is recognized and if it is, it's only in small academic corners of universities. From the mainstream perspective, there were the Greeks, the Persians, the Indians skip 1400 years and the European Renaissance just miraculously happened. No acknowledgement of Muslim contributions."
positive,amazon customer,"Absolutely brilliant book, indepth and offers great insight and clarity into the lost history of the islamic empire. Quality of the book was outstanding recommended to all."
positive,canopus72,"This book is an academic study in an unbiased light to demonstrate how much Islam and muslims have contributed to the world in terms of medicine, science, technology and art. This book serves to educate muslims of our heritage and remind us of why we are here and what our purpose is in life. It also serves to refute absurd and racist allegations given by many anti-Islam proponents that muslims never invented or discovered anything. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an open mind and is interested in eastern history. This truly is an antidote to educate the masses and dispel their prejudices. This is also a very good resource for teaching muslim children of the works of great muslim scholars."
positive,buthaina m,great book a bout Muslim inventions.
positive,casual_cool,"Must read to learn the developments within all fields about 1000 years ago (even robotics!). Very interesting, illustrative and easy to understand. I am sure it can be easily understood by young ones as much as for adults."
positive,malika debbah,"This is my fourth purchase of 1001 Islamic Inventions published by National Geographic. A treasure of information about science, medecine, law, mathematics, arts etc... in the Islamic worl who were far advanced at that time and still in practice today. A wonderful gift to give to parents or friends who have an inquisitive mind."
positive,dr beg,A book Full of WOW factor and great collection of knowledge. Quality printing and well referenced work.
positive,zaze,I'm quite surprised to see no reviews here. This book is an amazing read.

positive,abul,Really good book
positive,baba khan,"Amazing book, everyone should have it. This shows the real people who invested many of the science marvels, and it gives them due credit. Would recommend if have kids they'll know how many of todays science inventions were done and by whom. Nice to have in your collection and personal library."
positive,faisal khan,The Book Is Powerful as Its Contains The Birth of Modern Era with Origination of Scientific World. Muslims of The Time are so Curious of Ilm. They Helped The People of Time How to Live Together with Harmony of Love In Inventive Worldy Life. These are Some lines. I can Write More and More words for Thier Efforts of Making Us So Advance.
positive,jemand,Myself and my child found it very interesting and very important to read. This book is finger pointing the real golden age of the Islamic civilization which incorrectly and intentionally has been interpreted as dark ages.
positive,alizeh sohail,This book contains a ton of knowledge in an enjoyable and easy to read format. It gives you a good detail of Muslims' diverse and rich history. The book contains good historical pictures and is beautifully illustrated. The author Salim al-Hassani did a great job by filling in this void. Would definitely recommend this especially for young Muslims looking to reflect on their history.
positive,yasmin,Excellent book with colorful illustrations. Excellent quality print yet the font is very light. Dark font would be helpful for easy reading. Best gift to students and teachers.
critical,abdullah khan,I like this book because it has lots of facts and information
critical,sharp45,Sureficially written. There is no depth in the contents. Grey Texts are on the coloured background are very difficult to read.
critical,rikk and diana,"Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached"
critical,rick in houston,"The book would surely be interesting to look through, especially after having recently gone through John and Mary Gribbon's Science (British edition, The Scientists), and being familiar enough to remember that there were no large gaps unexplained in that account, and the Muslim contributions, while covered, were indeed few. If that is so, then it is so, and there is no legitimate purpose to be served by rewriting history."
critical,mamlukman,"For a reasoned and scholarly rebuttal, see ""1001 Distortions How (Not) to Narrate History of Science, Medicine, and Technology in Non-Western Cultures."" From the blurb: ""...amateurs have taken bits and pieces from our academic narratives and those of our predecessors, stripped them of their richness in detail and their often agonizing efforts to interpret these details, and rearranged them in simplifying and often misguided fashion as outdated stories about glory, success, priority and progress. Our texts are accompanied by reflections of professional curators and museum directors about the difficulties of translating academic research into representations that attract different groups of visitors."""
critical,marc coriolan,"Just to be clear, the remarkable new scientific ideas of the Mideast and the West did not arise out of religious fervor, crusades or jihads. Not out of the exegesis of a religious text. The new ideas arose out of repeated observations of the physical world."
critical,amir,My main problem with this book which I purchased to see the Islam contributions to world failed since this book was more an agenda to show who is arab and who is not! and giving all the credit of individual people to the empire they were possibly saving their life from their sword and their scientists needed money to operate in. in some cases definitely for a very shorter amount of time(like south of Spain).
critical,ahme b,Was slightly damaged. But a great book in itself
critical,25cent,Enjoyeble to read that wer are part of civilization that improve lives of many people living on this earth ...
positive,amazon customer,This book will reveal to you the truth of certain discoveries and how the Muslims contributed to civilization through societal connections and science. Highly recommended.

positive,eniro663,Beautiful book which should be shared with all children especially in this day and age where Muslims are being persecuted for the actions of a minority.
positive,mahfuz27,"From the very first few pages of text, it is truly inspiring. No longer do we have to skip over ""the dark ages"" of history. Instead, we can recognize an entire society for what it was: a bastion of learning.Without it, the renaissance would never have begun and without it, the dark ages that Europe was indeed plunged into could have persisted for centuries more. The society being described was the Islamic Ummayad Caliphate, showing what a nation -Properly- governed by the Qur'an and Sunnah(Traditions of the Prophet Muhammad, SAW) achieved for themselves and for the generations of people who came after them."

A must read books for everyone and children's edition is also written in a fun way which my nine year old loves reading.
positive,shehnaz shaikh,Was delivered as advised! Brilliant!.
positive,brand new parents,Got this as a gift for mixed race/faith neices to learn about their Muslim heritage in a positive way. Not a day goes by in the current climate where children are constantly subjected to negative stereotypes about Muslims and Islam so this book is vital to countering such simplistic and often xenophobic narratives.
positive,m bashir,This book is an amazing mass of information about the amazing inventions that the muslim world invented that are still relevant in the modern world. Its an eye opener to the non muslim who have this preconcieved idea that muslims haven't had any input in all these amazing inventions in this book.
positive,azad zangana,"i realy enjoyed the information,and its good for all ages,its worth every penny for the amount of knowlege you get about ISLAM."
positive,qasim,this book is an incredible look at the enduring legacy of invention and how there have been incredible strides made in science that were made in what seems like the stone age but it shows how this is a incredible legacy that can inspire change and change the course of history for centuries to come.
